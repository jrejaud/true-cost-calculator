Use NREL databases to calculate the raw materials and energy cost needed to build something

Final project for my enviromental engineering course was to research the total cost for an object of our choice. 
For example: What is the total petrol, raw materials, energy, ect needed to acquire all the ingredients, bring them to the factory and make a candy bar?

I figured that was probably going to be rather time consuming, so I used the US government's [NREL](http://www.nrel.gov/lci/) database and wrote a program in VBA to automate the entire process.
